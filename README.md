# esports Team Logos

An attempt to maintain a singular resource of team logos for active, and retired esports teams.

Teams are divided based on game.

The current dataset only contains a single large image. Resized / cropped images coming soon.

To request more images please create an issue or pull request.

How to Add more Team Logos:
1) Find team(s) with missing logos on LootLeague.com
2) Source image and save to desktop: game-name/team-name/team-name-logo.png on your desktop (Examples: csgo/faze-clan/faze-clan-logo.png or league-of-legends/mineski/mineski-logo.png)
3) Open https://github.com/lootmarket/esport-team-logos/upload/master
4) Drag and drop the folders
5) Type a brief title / desciption within `Commit Changes`
6) Click `Commit Changes`
